This repo aims to optimize the Delta-stepping algorithm (Ulrich Meyer and Peter Sanders. "δ-stepping: a parallelizable shortest path algorithm." Journal of Algorithms, 49(1):114–152, 2003.). 

The primary focus of this repo is to eliminate the need for tuning the delta value for the shortest path algorithm.
